## Description:
E-commerce Web Application Built with React, Node, and Express meant to highlight skills with Front-End development. I worked collaboratively in an Agile setting with 3 other engineers and was responsible for the Related Items and My Outfit Section. 

This section display products that are related to the product being shown in the Overview section. Also shown is the user's Outfit that they have saved and persists by being stored in the browsers localStorage object. All of the data is being fetched from an external API, that I rebuilt in a different project.
